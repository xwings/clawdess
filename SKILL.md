## Video Mode

### Workflow

1. **Use `--image` as source** (either a previously generated photo URL or any image URL)
2. **Generate video** from the image via AI provider

### Video Prompt

Video prompt is based on the action right after the image action or location. Keep it short.

**Examples:**
- Image of person in a living room → `the person walk towards the couch and sit down.`
- Image of person in a shopping mall → `the person walk around for window shopping`
- Image of person in a bed room → `smile and wink and say good night`

### Execute Video

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawdess.py video \
  --api "VIDEO_API_KEY" \
  --prompt "smile and wave at the camera" \
  --image "https://example.com/photo.png"
```

Optional flags: `--provider FAL|XAI`

### Photo + Video Together

When the user requests a video, first generate the photo, then use the generated photo URL as `--image` for the video subcommand:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate photo
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawdess.py photo \
  --api "PHOTO_API_KEY" \
  --prompt "Render this image as make a picture of this person, a full body photo. the person is taking a mirror selfie, playful smile, alone in her apartment. Normal phone camera selfie photo. Phone camera photo quality WITHOUT Depth of field." \
  --image "REFERENCE_IMAGE_URL"

# Step 2: Generate video from the photo (use IMAGE_URL from step 1 output)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawdess.py video \
  --api "VIDEO_API_KEY" \
  --prompt "goto couch and sitdown, face the camera" \
  --image "IMAGE_URL_FROM_STEP_1"
```

## Error Handling
- **API key missing**: Ensure the API key is set in environment or passed as argument
- **Image/voice generation failed**: Check prompt content and API quota

## Tips

1. **Mirror mode context examples** (outfit focus):
   - "wearing a santa hat", "in a business suit", "wearing a summer dress"

2. **Direct mode context examples** (location/portrait focus):
   - "a cozy cafe with warm lighting", "a sunny beach at sunset"

3. **Voice style**: Uses "Chelsie" voice (female, Chinese) by default. Keep voice messages short (under 30 seconds).

4. **Scheduling**: Combine with OpenClaw scheduler for automated posts
