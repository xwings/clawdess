clawdess is more than just a girlfriend. It's the perfect digital companion. Experience a playful, genuine connection with daily photos, captivating videos, and late-night voice notes that make you feel truly special.

## Demo

## Features

- **Photo** — AI-edited selfies from a reference image
- **Video** — Cinematic image-to-video scenes with dialogue; 15 seconds per part, longer videos chained and merged
- **Voice** — Text-to-speech voice messages

All media can be delivered to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, and MS Teams via [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

## Installation

Install as an OpenClaw skill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xwings/clawdess ~/.openclaw/skills/clawdess
```

### Requirements

- Python 3
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (with ffprobe) for videos longer than 15 seconds

### API Keys

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export CLAWDESS_PHOTO_API="your-photo-api-key"
export CLAWDESS_VIDEO_API="your-video-api-key"
export CLAWDESS_VOICE_API="your-voice-api-key"
```

Alternatively, pass them per-command with `--api`.

## Usage

```bash
# Generate and send a photo
python3 scripts/clawdess.py photo \
  --prompt "Render this image as make a pic of this person at a cafe, smiling" \
  --image "https://example.com/reference.png" \
  --channel discord --target "CHANNEL_ID"

# Generate a 15-second video scene from an image
python3 scripts/clawdess.py video \
  --prompt "Part 1 of 1, 15 seconds, one continuous scene. ..." \
  --image "https://example.com/photo.png"

# Generate a 30-second video: one --prompt per 15-second part
python3 scripts/clawdess.py video \
  --prompt "Part 1 of 2, 15 seconds, one continuous scene. ..." \
  --prompt "Part 2 of 2, 15 seconds, one continuous scene. ..." \
  --image "https://example.com/photo.png"

# Generate and send a voice message
python3 scripts/clawdess.py voice \
  --prompt "Hey! How are you doing today?" \
  --channel discord --target "CHANNEL_ID"
```

The `--channel` and `--target` flags are optional — omit them to generate media without sending.

Each video provider call renders one 15-second part. For a longer video, pass one `--prompt` per part: every part starts from the previous part's last frame, and ffmpeg merges the parts into one MP4 in `~/.openclaw/media/clawdess/`. Zipped provider results are unpacked automatically.
